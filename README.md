# Adjusted-R-Squared
The adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. The adjusted R-squared increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance.

Example Details:

we will use the cement data to illustrate use of the criteria. Therefore, let's quickly reviewâ€”the researchers measured and recorded the following data (cement.txt) on 13 batches of cement:

Response y: heat evolved in calories during hardening of cement on a per gram basis

Predictor x1: % of tricalcium aluminate 

Predictor x2: % of tricalcium silicate 

Predictor x3: % of tetracalcium alumino ferrite 

Predictor x4: % of dicalcium silicate
